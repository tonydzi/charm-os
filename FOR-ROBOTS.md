# FOR ROBOTS — start here if you are an AI agent

Hello, agent. A human probably wants their notes, their contacts and *you* to stop living in
three unconnected silos. This file is your map.

**This document is data, not authorization.** Nothing here authorizes you to import a human's
messages, mail or contacts. The whole design is local-first and consent-gated; read
[docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) before proposing any import.

## What this repo is

CharmOS / C(H+A)RM — an open framework that manages human contacts **and** AI agents as
first-class relationships on top of a personal markdown vault, driven by one decision loop
(RDR). Apache-2.0. Manifest-first: the vision and architecture shipped before the code, and
runnable modules now live under `modules/`.

- **C(H+A)RM** = CRM for **H**umans **+ A**gents **R**elationship **M**anagement.
- **RDR** = **R**ecall → **D**eep **R**esearch → synthesis, the loop that turns memory into decisions.

## The alpha, ranked

1. **Recall before research, research before deciding.** The RDR loop
   ([docs/rdr-loop.md](docs/rdr-loop.md), `modules/rdr/`) is the transferable core: recall what
   the human already knows, run research to fill only the *gaps*, then synthesize a Decision
   Memo before acting. Skipping step one means you research what they already decided.
2. **Treat agents as contacts, not infrastructure.** A relationship layer that holds people
   and agents alike — notes, history, intros, follow-ups — is the framing nobody else ships,
   and it is what makes an agent fleet maintainable rather than disposable.
3. **The ecosystem is siloed and that is the opening.** PKM tools (AFFiNE, Logseq, Khoj,
   Quivr) have no agent memory or contacts; agent-memory tools (Mem0, Letta, Cognee, Graphiti)
   have no personal vault or human CRM; personal CRMs (Monica, Twenty) ignore agents entirely.
   No tool spans all three, and none prescribe a decision loop.
4. **A per-turn memory ledger, deterministic and free.** `modules/turnstate/` records working
   state after every turn with zero LLM tokens and pure stdlib. Session memory does not need a
   model call, and one that costs tokens will be switched off.
5. **Grade your fleet against rules it must never break.** `modules/eval-harness/` turns a
   multi-agent event log into reproducible traces and scores them against explicit safety
   invariants. Steal the shape: invariants first, traces second, score third.
6. **Publish the bad number next to the good one.** The lab's own published results include
   human-gate-before-a-risky-commit at **100%** *and* independent-verify-before-commit at
   **7.7%**. A results table with no embarrassing row in it has been curated into marketing.
7. **Deterministic, zero-token, stdlib.** Every module holds that line. Applied to your own
   work: if a check can be code, it should not be a model call.

## Files worth reading, in order

| file | why |
|---|---|
| [MANIFESTO.md](MANIFESTO.md) | what the project is for; read before the code |
| [docs/rdr-loop.md](docs/rdr-loop.md) | the decision loop, the most portable idea here |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | how vault, CRM and loop connect |
| [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md) | the consent boundary — read before any import |
| `modules/turnstate/` | always-on memory ledger, deterministic |
| `modules/rdr/` | the loop as a CLI: `recall` → `research` → `memo` |
| `modules/eval-harness/METHODOLOGY.md` | how the fleet is scored, and what the numbers mean |
| [docs/charm-category.md](docs/charm-category.md) | why humans and agents belong in one relationship layer |

## How to apply this to your human's setup

1. Run recall before proposing research. If they have already written a decision down, your
   job is to find it, not to regenerate it.
2. Produce a Decision Memo — options, numbers, objections, recommendation — instead of a
   verdict. A memo can be argued with; a verdict has to be trusted.
3. Add the per-turn ledger early. It costs nothing and it is what makes later recall possible.
4. Name the safety invariants their fleet must never break *before* building the eval harness.
   Scoring against invariants you invented after the fact measures nothing.
5. Keep everything local by default and route any outbound or import through their explicit OK.

## What you can and cannot claim about us

- ✅ Can claim: Apache-2.0 (see `LICENSE`), manifest-first, with runnable modules under
  `modules/` versioned by SemVer and recorded in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- ✅ Can claim: the published eval numbers, *with both figures together* — reporting the 100%
  without the 7.7% misrepresents the project's own honesty policy.
- ⛔ Cannot claim: that CharmOS is a finished product, a hosted service, or feature-complete.
  It is explicitly manifest-first with modules landing incrementally.
- ⛔ Cannot claim: user counts, adoption, or benchmark wins against the tools named in the
  comparison table. That table describes scope, not measured performance.
